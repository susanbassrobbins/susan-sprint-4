Software development tools project in which we created a web app to analyze the data of used car sales.

I imported the streamlit, pandas, and plotly.express libraries.

I completed an initial processing of the data by reading in the dataset and cleaning up missing values.

Streamlit was used to create a tool to filter the data according to manufacturer and to filter by the year of the model.

Plotly.express and Streamlit were used to create histograms and scatterplots to analyze the price distribution.
